# :material-controller: Basic Inputs

This section will give you an overview over the basic inputs on your device. Additionally, it will help you understand the **terminology** which is used throughout this wiki and within the retro gaming community.

## The face buttons

![Face buttons](/_inc/images/face-buttons.png){ align=right }

Most KNULLI-compatible handhelds have a set of face buttons - usually on the right side of the device. On most devices, you have four face buttons. Depending on your device and/or controller, the buttons may have different labels.

KNULLI mostly follows the labeling system known from SNES and the Anbernic devices. However, the buttons are sometimes also referred to by their respective directions to avoid confusion for users of PlayStation or Xbox controllers.

### Face buttons on different systems

| KNULLI  | Location                        |Direction | PS      | XBOX    |
| ------- | ------------------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| ++"X"++ | :material-gamepad-circle-up:    | North     | ++"△"++ | ++"Y"++ |
| ++"A"++ | :material-gamepad-circle-right: | East      | ++"○"++ | ++"B"++ |
| ++"B"++ | :material-gamepad-circle-down:  | South     | ++"✕"++ | ++"A"++ |
| ++"Y"++ | :material-gamepad-circle-left:  | West      | ++"◻"++ | ++"X"++ |

!!! info "Switch confirm/cancel in EmulationStation"

    By default, KNULLI follows the control scheme of Nintendo devices in all menus: ++"A"++ for *OK/confirm* and ++"B"++ for *cancel/back*. However, if you feel more familiar with the PlayStation scheme, press ++"Start"++ to bring up the main menu, go to *System settings* and find *Frontend Developer Options*. Here you will find a toggle to *Switch confirm & cancel buttons in EmulationStation*.

!!! info "In-game prompts might not match the labels on your device"

    KNULLI is a CFW for retro gaming emulation which also supports certain ports of Linux games. The labels on the device are labeled Nintendo-style as explained in the table above: ++"A"++ is **east** (:material-gamepad-circle-right:), ++"B"++ is **south** (:material-gamepad-circle-down:), and so on.

    It should be obvious, but since some users reported this as a "bug", please understand this:

    Many games will prompt for button labels which **do not match** the labels printed on the buttons of your handheld. For example, if you play a PSX or PSP game and the game prompts for **△**, you need to press the ++"X"++ button (north, :material-gamepad-circle-up:), since the north button is labeled **△** on PlayStation controllers, as explained in the table above.

    Please be aware that **many PortMaster games** are hard-wired to consider your device as an **Xbox controller**. Hence, the games will give you **Xbox-style prompts**. Consequently, if a PortMaster game prompts for you to press the south button, chances are it will ask you to press **A**, however, it might be required for you to press ++"B"++ instead. We understand that this is counterintuitive, however,  it is still the **correct mapping by position**.

    ### Switch A/B and X/Y for ports

    If you struggle with Xbox-style prompts of a ports game, it is possible to **break the correct cardinal mapping** and enforce an **incorrect cardinal mapping** which maps the buttons **by label** instead. This can **only** be set on a per-game basis in the *Ports* section:
    
    * Go to the *Ports* section and pick the game you want to play with broken cardinal mapping
    * Hold the button which launches the game (++"A"++ or ++"B"++, depending on your setup) to bring up the game menu
    * Go to *Advanced Game Options*
    * Find *Switch A/B and X/Y* and turn it *on*

    Be aware that this will make some games hardly playable since all the actions are in the wrong place now.

## The ++"Function"++ button

Each KNULLI-driven device has a dedicated button we refer to as the ++"Function"++ button. Depending on your device, the ++"Function"++ button can be in different places. E.g., for the Anbernic RG35XX H, the button is located at the top right of the device, indicated by the letter *F*. (Sometimes, the ++"Function"++ button is also referred to as the "menu" button, the "FN" button, the "F" button, or the "hotkey".)

The button can be used to trigger a number of shortcuts which will help you control the currently running emulation core. Learn more about KNULLIs default shortcuts in the [Hotkey Shortcuts section](../hotkey-shortcuts).

!!! info "Select substitutes as function button on many external controllers"

    When playing with Bluetooth controllers without a ++"Function"++ button, the ++"Select"++ button often can be used as a substitute. However, be aware that in this case the default *select* action of the respective context is *also* triggered when you press the button.


## The ++"Power"++ button

When your device is turned off, the power button can be used to turn on your KNULLI device as explained in the manual of your device. Once your Knulli device is turned on

* **tap** the **power button** once to switch into **sleep mode** (depending on your device, there might still be a lot of power consumption in sleep mode).
* **hold** the **power button** for **2 seconds** (until the device vibrates) to do a normal **shutdown**.
    * All system settings you made since you last booted your device will be saved automatically.
    * If you are playing a game with a RetroArch core, your game will be saved automatically.
    * If you are playing a game with a standalone emulator your game will **not** be saved automatically.
* **hold** the **power button** for **5 or more seconds** to **cut the power off**, overriding the normal shutdown.
    * **Nothing** will be saved - this is meant as a last resort when your device is frozen!
* **hold** the ++"Function"++ button and **tap** the **power button** to switch between LED modes:
     * LED always on (default)
     * LED turns off while playing (LED blinks to confirm)
     * LED always off
     * The LED mode will reset to default after each reboot/shutdown.

## Clamshell lid

Some devices have clamshell form factor and therefore a lid. Depending on the device, it might be possible to use the lid for  **entering sleep mode** or **shutting down** the device.

!!! info "Returning from sleep mode when opening the lid"

    It is **impossible** for us to run **any** program code while a device is **turned off** or in **sleep mode**. Consequently, if the lid isn't hard-wired on the hardware level to act like a power button, it is **impossible** for us to register if the lid opens while the device is **turned off** or in **sleep mode**, simply **because** the device is **turned off** or in **sleep mode**.

    Consequently, we cannot make such a device (e.g., the **Anbernic RG35XX SP**) wake up or boot when the lid opens. There is no point in asking our developers on Discord for the feature. There is no point in waiting for the feature. There is no point in pressuring. For some devices, it simply cannot be done.

## The toggle switch

Some devices, e.g. the TrimUI Brick and the TrimUI Smart Pro come with a toggle switch. The toggle switch is an additional input that can be configured in *Device Settings*:

* Press ++"Start" to bring up the main menu
* Go to *Device Settings*
* Find *Toggle Switch Mode* and set it to
    * *mute/unmute* to mute and unmute the device via toggle switch
    * *RGB on/off* to enable or disable RGB LED via toggle switch
    * *Airplane mode on/off* to enable or disable airplane mode via toggle switch
