# :material-wifi-plus: Network Transfer

Network transfer can be used on any device which can be connected to the internet or a local network. (This includes devices with native networking capabilites and ones where networking can be added through an external dongle.)

This option first requires you to set up networking on your device.  Please see [Networking](../../../configure/networking) for details. Once you have completed those steps, you will need

* the hostname and/or IP address of your device.
* the root password, if additional security measurements are in place, as explained in the [Networking](../../../configure/networking) section.

### Windows networks (SMB)

Like many other operating systems, KNULLI supports SMB, the Windows network protocol. Depending on the type of computer you have, there are different options to transfer your games and other data via SMB.

After you successfully logged in, you will be able to access the `share` partition as a network drive. The network drive corresponds to your current [`/userdata` folder](../game-storage). Here, you can put all your data (games, etc.) in the respective folders.

#### Windows

On every Windows computer, SMB is integrated into the *Windows Explorer*.

If you want to access your KNULLI device regularly, you can even assign a drive letter to make it show up in *This PC*. By doing so, you will even be able to see, how much space you have left on your SD card.

!!! danger "Troubleshooting"

    - The name of the device corresponds to the **hostname** set it your KNULLI device. If `KNULLI` does not work, check the current **hostname** in the *Network Settings* of your KNULLI device. you can also use the **IP address** of your device when typing directly into the address bar.
    - If additional security measurements are in place, you will be prompted for your credentials.
        - The expected username is `root`, the password is the **root password** shown in the *Security* section of the *System Settings*.
    
#### macOS

- Open finder, select *Go* and then *Connect to Server* from the top menu.
- In the address bar that appears, type either `smb://[HOSTNAME]` or `smb://[IP-ADDRESS]` into the address bar (replace `[HOSTNAME]` with the hostname or `[IP-ADDRESS]` with the IP address of your device).
- If additional security measurements are in place, you will be prompted for your credentials.
    - The expected username is `root`, the password is the *Root password* shown in the *Security* section of the *System settings*.

### SCP/FTP

Using your SCP/FTP program of choice; set up an SCP/SFTP connection to the IP address to your KNULLI device. You will need the hostname or the IP address of the device (the default hostname is `KNULLI`). Make sure the port is set to `22`. The expected username is `root` and the expected password is the *Root password* you will find in the *Security* section of the *System settings* (the default password is `linux`).

!!! info "Parts of KNULLI are read-only"

    Unlike the *SMB* file transfer, SCP/FTP will provide access to the **entire** KNULLI file system, not just the `/userdata` folder. However, **everything outside** of the `/userdata` folder is **read-only** - you **can** edit, change, remove, and delete files, but your changes will be **undone** every time you **reboot**.
    
    If you want to make persistent chances outside of the `/userdata` folder, please have a look at the section about [Patches and Overlays](../../../configure/patches-and-overlays).

For Windows users, we recommend to use [WinSCP](https://winscp.net). After installing WinSCP on your Windows computer, follow these steps to establish a SCP connection to your KNULLI device, where you will able to drag-and-drop or copy/paste files directly from the *Windows Explorer*:

### After transferring your data

Once your data is completely transferred, make sure to update your gamelists to make the data available. You can do so by pressing ++"Start"++ to open the main menu, then open *Game settings* and select *Update gamelists*. KNULLI will rescan all game folders and identify all the games you added to make them available in EmulationStation.
