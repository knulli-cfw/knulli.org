	Sorry, we're working on it! :smile: Until it's done, you might want to join us on [:simple-discord: Discord](https://discord.gg/HXPS3DAeeB) to get in touch - maybe we can help you there!

# Netplay Prerequisites

* A device with wireless capability
* *Network Settings* > *Enable Wifi* is turned on.  Devices can either connect to the same access point or connect to no access points and use ad hoc networking to directly connect.
* *Game Settings* > *Netplay Settings* > *Enable Netplay* is turned on.
* If ad hoc networking will be used, also enable *Automatically Use Hotspot for Local Netplay* and, optionally, *Automatically Create Lobby*
  
# To host a netplay game:

* Long press east on a supported game in the gamelist and select Start a Netplay Game.
* Then select *Host a Netplay Game*.  The game will start and set up the netplay host.

# To join a netplay game:

* Run the same game (preferably same exact ROM).
* Press menu+south to enter the Retroarch Menu.
* Press south to go up one menu then move down to *Netplay*.
* Select *Refresh Netplay LAN List* and press east to look for games.
* Select the host from the list and press east to join the game.
* If the host does not appear, double check the wifi settings and make sure that the devices are on the same access point.  In the case of ad hoc, in some cirmustances you may need to manually connect to the ad hoc access point started by the host before running the game.

Further configuration parameters like ad hoc access point name and port can be found in batocera.conf.
