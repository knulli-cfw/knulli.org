My battery seems to discharge faster on Knulli than on stock OS, even in sleep mode or when completely turned off!","text":"<p>Read this before reporting battery issues</p> <p>Due to the reasons explained below, it is not helpful at all to report battery issues based on the displayed percentage. Telling us that your battery lost 10% of battery while the device was turned off does not help, because you cannot possibly know if that number is even correct. Currently, the only valid way to investigate your battery issues with KNULLI is to watch the power indicator LED of your device and measure the time it takes for the device to drain completely. E.g., when investigating sleep mode efficiency, charge the device fully, put it in sleep mode and see how long it takes for the device to drain completely.</p> <p>A: To our knowledge, there is no difference between the efficiency of sleep modes between KNULLI and the initial version of the Anbernic stock OS. However, experiments indicate that the improved stock OS sleep mode performs better than the the sleep mode provided by KNULLI. Since Anbernic does not make their source code available, our developers are still examining the stock OS to determine what changes they made to further improve their sleep mode. Until we figure this out, KNULLI will only provide regular sleep mode which consumes about 5% of battery charge per hour.</p> <p>If you perceive that your device discharges too fast, there's a variety of factors which might be at play here:</p> <ul> <li>The battery indicator of Emulation Station (the KNULLI frontend) has a bug which causes it to get stuck sometimes. It is a known issue that is being worked on. However, until the issue is fixed, you cannot rely on the accuracy of the displayed battery percentage. Restarting the device or updating gamelists might temporarily fix the issue, however, it will happen again.</li> <li>The battery percentage that can be read from the battery drivers sometimes gives inaccurate readings. Our developers noticed that sometimes the battery percentage reported directly from the battery makes rather large jumps, e.g., from 93% directly to 100% when charging. Consequently, even if your battery indicator is not stuck, the displayed battery percentage might still be a little inaccurate.</li> <li>The regular sleep mode provided by the kernel for the Anbernic devices of that series is very inefficient, especially compared to modern smartphones or similar devices:<ul> <li>It applies a simple suspend to RAM, which means that many components of the device are shut off, but the entire state of the device is kept in RAM (Random Access Memory). Consequently, the device will still require some power to keep the RAM active.</li> <li>The Anbernic devices of that series consume a lot of power to maintain the RAM in sleep mode, which is why you might notice a discharge of about 5% per hour, so you cannot put the device to sleep indefinitely.</li> <li>The improved sleep mode seems to save more power, however, it is still unknown to us how this is achieved.</li> <li>More efficient power management could be achieved by implementing suspend to disk, which would keep the state of the device in a persistent memory, such as a hard disk or an SD card.

Some games do not work at all, others are simply unable to save and load any settings or game progress.</p> <p>For that reason, previous KNULLI versions employed the ext4 file system, a very specific Linux file system which is not accessible from a Windows computer, leaving USB- and network transfer to be the only reasonable ways to access your SD card and add your games, BIOSes, etc.</p>"},{"location":"guides/portmaster-and-exfat/#most-ports-are-fixed-by-now","title":"Most ports are fixed by now","text":"<p>The mighty Port Navigators, our friends at PortMaster, have found a solution to the problem and applied it to most of their games. All the most popular games and fan-favorites have been fixed already, which is why you probably do not need to worry about this issue anymore.</p> <p>Instead of relying on symbolic links, they now employ a similar concept called bind mount. When put in layman's terms, the difference between those two concepts is rather subtle: A symbolic link is a file that is stored in the file system and points to another file or folder. In contrast, a bind mount simply tells the running operating system to address a file from a different path. It is also a pointer, however, it is kept in memory and does not have to be stored in the file system. Consequently, it will not cause any issues with exFAT drives.</p> <p>However, there's still a few games left which haven't been updated, yet. So, if you are really unlucky, you might find a game that does not work with bind mounts, yet.</p>"},{"location":"guides/portmaster-and-exfat/#possible-solutions","title":"Possible solutions","text":"<p>Luckily, you have two options to enjoy these PortMaster games on your KNULLI-driven device anyway:</p> <ul> <li>Be patient - the Port Navigators might fix the game at some point</li> <li>Format to ext4</li> <li>Do something about it</li> </ul>"},{"location":"guides/portmaster-and-exfat/#format-to-ext4","title":"Format to ext4","text":"<p>KNULLI also comes with a built-in formatter that you may use to format any secondary SD card to ext4 as explained in the Formatting section. ext4 is a Linux file system which supports symbolic links. Consequently, if you simply format to ext4, it will not make a difference to you whether a game employs symbolic links or not. PortMaster will just work, that's it.</p> <p>However, ext4 comes at a price: You will not be able to access your ext4 SD card from a Windows computer. Windows does not support the ext4 file system. On your Windows computer, the drive will simply appear as unreadable and Windows will ask you to format the drive to make is accessible. Hence, you will be restricted to accessing your SD card via Wi-Fi as explained in the Network Transfer section. Unfortunately, network transfer is significantly slower than direct access to the SD card.</p> <p>Some users consider ext4 a great inconvenience, especially those who want to play on devices without Wi-Fi capability (e.g., the Anbernic RG28XX and RG35XX 2024).

You will have to replace all of them.</p> <p>In case of Stardew Valley, for example, the culprit looks like this:</p> <pre><code># Setup savedir\n$ESUDO rm -rf ~/.config/StardewValley\nln -sfv \"$gamedir/savedata\" ~/.config/StardewValley\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>The first line of the above starts with the <code>#</code> symbol, which indicates that the line does not contain program code but simply a comment to help you understand what the code does.</li> <li>The second line launches the <code>rm</code> command to remove the existing symbolic link at <code>~/.config/StardewValley</code> from your device.</li> <li>The third line launches the <code>ln</code> command to create a new symbolic link at <code>~/.config/StardewValley</code> which will point to <code>\"$gamedir/savedata\"</code>. The first path is the target of the pointer, the second path is the location of the pointer.</li> </ul> <p>Furthermore, it is important to understand that you will always need to remove both: The <code>rm</code> command that deletes the link and the <code>ln</code> command that (re-)creates it. You need to make sure to replace both lines with just one new line: A call to <code>bind_directories</code>. <code>bind_directories</code> is a new PortMaster function which will create the bind mount for you. Pay attention though: The order of both path arguments is reversed now! <code>bind_directories</code> expects the location first! The target of the pointer is the second parameter now!</p> <pre><code># Setup savedir\nbind_directories ~/.config/StardewValley \"$gamedir/savedata\"\n</code></pre> <p>Remove the <code>rm</code> command line entirely. Replace the <code>ln</code> command (including its modifiers) with <code>bind_directories</code>, switch target and location.</p> <p>In the end, there will be only the <code>bind_directories</code> command.</p> <p>That's it!

Internally, KNULLI has a folder called <code>/userdata</code> where all your data (games, screenshots, bezels, saves, configurations, themes, etc.) will be stored. On a single-SD-card setup, the <code>/userdata</code> folder will always point to the SHARE partition of your primary SD card. If you have a device with more than one SD card slot and choose to create a dual-SD-card setup, the <code>/userdata</code> folder will point to the main partition of your secondary SD card instead.</p> <p>Consequently, you will not be able to use the SHARE partition of SD 1 and SD 2 at the same time. Only one of those SD cards can be mounted as <code>/userdata</code> at a time. When you access your storage via SMB network transfer or MTP, you will only find one SHARE folder, which will always point at your <code>/userdata</code> folder. Therefore, when running a dual-SD-card setup, your internal SHARE partition will neither be used by KNULLI, nor be accessible via network transfer or MTP.</p> <p>Internal and external storage</p> <p>You can switch between single/dual SD card mode by following the steps in the section about Using a second SD card. Basically, by switching between internal/external storage, you just tell KNULLI which drive/partition <code>/userdata</code> should point to.</p> <p>Understanding mounting on Linux</p> <p>Windows users might not know this: On Linux systems, drives are not addressed by \"drive letters\" like you know it from your Windows machine. Instead, Linux mounts the drives into folders. The Linux file system does not know any drive letters at all, it consists of just one file tree with <code>/</code> being the \"root\" of the tree. Every folder that exists is a subfolder of <code>/</code>.</p> <p>You might imagine <code>/</code> to be roughly comparable to <code>C:\\</code> on your Windows machine. Try to imagine that, when plugging an USB stick, the stick will not appear as <code>D:\\</code> but as a folder on <code>C:\\</code>, e.g. <code>C:\\media\\my-usb-stick\\</code>.</p> <p>KNULLI is a Linux, so it uses the Linux file system. More specifically, KNULLI always needs to have a folder called <code>/userdata</code> (again, roughly comparable to <code>C:\\userdata</code>) where KNULLI expects all your data (games, themes, saves, etc.) to be located. However <code>/userdata</code> is also a mount point for a drive. By switching between internal and external, you basically tell KNULLI where <code>/userdata</code> should point to after the next boot - it is either the internal SHARE partition or SD 2.</p> <p>KNULLI expects all your data to be in <code>/userdata</code>, it does not look for games, themes, or anything else outside of the pre-defined folder structure.
